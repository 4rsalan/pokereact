Remake of my original randomizer but in React

A small web app randomizer made with the purpose of simulating a gameplay challenge in certain Pokemon games called the "Battle Factory"

The app lets you pick the number of users participating and allows you to randomize a selected pool of pokemon equally between all the users. This app can also be used in settings outside Pokemon. One example is if the user needs to make teams for a sporting event. They can enter the number of teams and the pool of available players and randomize the players to a team.

List of pokemon can be generated from this website https://pokemondb.net/tools/text-list

Instructions

Enter the number of players playing and press "Create Players!"
Enter the names of the players and the maximum amount of pokemon per player
Press "Generate Players!"
Enter the list of pokemon line by line into the textarea and then press randomize
You can randomize as many times as desired and the pool can be modified as long as it meets the minimum requirements calculated by the app
